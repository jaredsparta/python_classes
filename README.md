# OOP - Object Oriented Programming
- What are classes
- Why do we use classes

**The Four Pillars**
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

**Classes**
- A class is the main factor used to implement these pillars
- It is the "blueprint" for the objects we use in python

```python
    class <name>:
        # The __init__ runs whenever the class is called
        __init__(self, <parameters>):
            self.<parameter1> = <parameter1>

```
